# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:R.O

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter can be a few diferent data types that you use as placeholders until you invoke with an argrument. A argrument is the actual data that is being called while invoking a function.

Researched answer: A parameter is a variable. It is a placeholder and doesn't hold any real value. A argrument is a value passed when calling a function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: index, value (can't remember the optional answeer) index and value are required.

Researched answer: What the parameters are named is up to you as long as the order is the same. Value is required but say index and array are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:.map() iterates through an array and returns whatever logic thats in it's code block. .filter() iterates through an array and return whatever logic thats in it's code block but also returns as a new subset.

Researched answer: .map() changes each value in a array and creates a new array with those changed values while .filter can create a new array under specifed conditions.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: To iterate is to move through a array and then stop once a certain condition is complete.

Researched answer: iteration is a action performed a number of times or until a condition is met.
You can think about the actions of a for loop. this is iteration.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Honestly I'm not sure on the answer. A function is a variable that contain a block a code that you would write the code's logic in. A Method is a tool with pre made functions that you can add to your variable.

Researched answer: functions can execute a set of conditions on a data type or variable and return the resluts. A method is like a function but have a set of conditions to peform a task. Methods are also associated with an object while functions aren't.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I'm not sure with this answer again but it sounds like bringing two things together like an variable and a object with dot notation.

Researched answer: hoisting is to make and use a variable put the top of code block but not declared until later.
